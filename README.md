# C Multi-Client Chat Server
A robust, multi-threaded socket-based messaging system that enables multiple clients to connect to a centralized chat server.

## Overview
This project implements a complete client-server architecture with the following features:
- Multi-threaded design: Both client and server use separate threads for handling message sending, receiving, and processing
- Non-blocking I/O: Socket operations are non-blocking for better performance
